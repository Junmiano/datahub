# Data Sources

This directory contains a curated list of external data sources relevant to our community. Each entry provides information about valuable datasets hosted elsewhere.

## Structure

Each data source is documented in a separate markdown file using a descriptive name, for example: `city-population-data.md` or `air-quality-index.md`.

## Contributing

To add a new data source:

1. Create a new file with a descriptive name that reflects the content of the data source.
2. Use the [data source template](../docs/data-source-template.md) to structure your entry.
3. Ensure you provide accurate information about data access, format, update frequency, and usage restrictions.
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the addition.

Please refer to our [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more detailed guidelines.
